+TODO: describe compat status here.
+
+One questionable point of the design is netlink usage:
+
+We have 1 second timeout by default to poll the link status,
+it is short enough so that there are no real benefits in
+using netlink to get "instantaneous" interface creation/deletion
+notifications. We can check for interface existence by just
+doing some fast ioctl using its name.
+
+Netlink code then can be just dropped (1k or more?)
