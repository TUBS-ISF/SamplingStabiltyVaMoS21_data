 Here's a typical code snippet from the init script:

 The simple explanation here is that [1] you need to have /sys mounted before
-executing mdev.  Then you [2] instruct the kernel to execute /bin/mdev whenever
+executing mdev.  Then you [2] instruct the kernel to execute /sbin/mdev whenever
 a device is added or removed so that the device node can be created or
 destroyed.  Then you [3] seed /dev with all the device nodes that were created
 while the system was booting.
