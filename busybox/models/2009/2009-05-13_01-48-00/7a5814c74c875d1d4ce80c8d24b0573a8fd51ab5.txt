-<h1>General questions</h1>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="getting_started">How can I get started using BusyBox?</a></h2>
-
-<p> If you just want to try out busybox without installing it, download the
-    tarball, extract it, run "make defconfig", and then run "make".
-</p>
-<p>
-    This will create a busybox binary with almost all features enabled.  To try
-    out a busybox applet, type "./busybox [appletname] [options]", for
-    example "./busybox ls -l" or "./busybox cat LICENSE".  Type "./busybox"
-    to see a command list, and "busybox appletname --help" to see a brief
-    usage message for a given applet.
-</p>
-<p>
-    BusyBox uses the name it was invoked under to determine which applet is
-    being invoked.  (Try "mv busybox ls" and then "./ls -l".)  Installing
-    busybox consists of creating symlinks (or hardlinks) to the busybox
-    binary for each applet in busybox, and making sure these links are in
-    the shell's command $PATH.  The special applet name "busybox" (or with
-    any optional suffix, such as "busybox-static") uses the first argument
-    to determine which applet to run, as shown above.
-</p>
-<p>
-    BusyBox also has a feature called the
-    <a name="standalone_shell">"standalone shell"</a>, where the busybox
-    shell runs any built-in applets before checking the command path.  This
-    feature is also enabled by "make allyesconfig", and to try it out run
-    the command line "PATH= ./busybox ash".  This will blank your command path
-    and run busybox as your command shell, so the only commands it can find
-    (without an explicit path such as /bin/ls) are the built-in busybox ones.
-    This is another good way to see what's built into busybox.
-    Note that the standalone shell requires CONFIG_BUSYBOX_EXEC_PATH
-    to be set appropriately, depending on whether or not /proc/self/exe is
-    available or not. If you do not have /proc, then point that config option
-    to the location of your busybox binary, usually /bin/busybox.
-    (So if you set it to /proc/self/exe, and happen to be able to chroot into
-    your rootfs, you must mount /proc beforehand.)
-</p>
-<p>
-    A typical indication that you set CONFIG_BUSYBOX_EXEC_PATH to proc but
-    forgot to mount proc is:
-<pre>
-$ /bin/echo $PATH
-/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11
-$ echo $PATH
-/bin/sh: echo: not found
-</pre>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="configure">How do I configure busybox?</a></h2>
-
-<p> Busybox is configured similarly to the linux kernel.  Create a default
-    configuration and then run "make menuconfig" to modify it.  The end
-    result is a .config file that tells the busybox build process what features
-    to include.  So instead of "./configure; make; make install" the equivalent
-    busybox build would be "make defconfig; make; make install".
-</p>
-
-<p> Busybox configured with all features enabled is a little under a megabyte
-    dynamically linked on x86.  To create a smaller busybox, configure it with
-    fewer features.  Individual busybox applets cost anywhere from a few
-    hundred bytes to tens of kilobytes.  Disable unneeded applets to save,
-    space, using menuconfig.
-</p>
-
-<p>The most important busybox configurators are:</p>
-
-<ul>
-<li><p>make <b>defconfig</b> - Create the maximum "sane" configuration.  This
-enables almost all features, minus things like debugging options and features
-that require changes to the rest of the system to work (such as selinux or
-devfs device names).  Use this if you want to start from a full-featured
-busybox and remove features until it's small enough.</p></li>
-<li><p>make <b>allnoconfig</b> - Disable everything.  This creates a tiny version
-of busybox that doesn't do anything.  Start here if you know exactly what
-you want and would like to select only those features.</p></li>
-<li><p>make <b>menuconfig</b> - Interactively modify a .config file through a
-multi-level menu interface.  Use this after one of the previous two.</p></li>
-</ul>
-
-<p>Some other configuration options are:</p>
-<ul>
-<li><p>make <b>oldconfig</b> - Update an old .config file for a newer version
-of busybox.</p></li>
-<li><p>make <b>allyesconfig</b> - Select absolutely everything.  This creates
-a statically linked version of busybox full of debug code, with dependencies on
-selinux, using devfs names...  This makes sure everything compiles.  Whether
-or not the result would do anything useful is an open question.</p></li>
-<li><p>make <b>allbareconfig</b> - Select all applets but disable all sub-features
-within each applet.  More build coverage testing.</p></li>
-<li><p>make <b>randconfig</b> - Create a random configuration for test purposes.</p></li>
-</ul>
-
-<p> Menuconfig modifies your .config file through an interactive menu where you can enable or disable
-    busybox features, and get help about each feature.
-
-<p>
-    To build a smaller busybox binary, run "make menuconfig" and disable the
-    features you don't need.  (Or run "make allnoconfig" and then use
-    menuconfig to add just the features you need.  Don't forget to recompile
-    with "make" once you've finished configuring.)
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="build">How do I build BusyBox with a cross-compiler?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-   To build busybox with a cross-compiler, specify CROSS_COMPILE=&lt;prefix&gt;.
-</p>
-<p>
-   CROSS_COMPILE specifies the prefix used for all executables used
-   during compilation. Only gcc and related binutils executables
-   are prefixed with $(CROSS_COMPILE) in the makefiles.
-   CROSS_COMPILE can be set on the command line:
-</p>
-<pre>
-   make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-uclibcgnueabi-
-</pre>
-<p>
-   Alternatively CROSS_COMPILE can be set in the environment.
-   Default value for CROSS_COMPILE is not to prefix executables.
-</p>
-<p>
-   To store the cross-compiler in your .config, set the variable
-   CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX accordingly in menuconfig or by
-   editing the .config file.
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="build_system">How do I build a BusyBox-based system?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    BusyBox is a package that replaces a dozen standard packages, but it is
-    not by itself a complete bootable system.  Building an entire Linux
-    distribution from source is a bit beyond the scope of this FAQ, but it
-    understandably keeps cropping up on the mailing list, so here are some
-    pointers.
-</p>
-<p>
-    Start by learning how to strip a working system down to the bare essentials
-    needed to run one or two commands, so you know what it is you actually
-    need.  An excellent practical place to do
-    this is the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO/">Linux
-    BootDisk Howto</a>, or for a more theoretical approach try
-    <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html">From
-    PowerUp to Bash Prompt</a>.
-</p>
-<p>
-    To learn how to build a working Linux system entirely from source code,
-    the place to go is the <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">Linux
-    From Scratch</a> project.  They have an entire book of step-by-step
-    instructions you can
-    <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/">read online</a>
-    or
-    <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/">download</a>.
-    Be sure to check out the other sections of their main page, including
-    Beyond Linux From Scratch, Hardened Linux From Scratch, their Hints
-    directory, and their LiveCD project.  (They also have mailing lists which
-    are better sources of answers to Linux-system building questions than
-    the busybox list.)
-</p>
-<p>
-    If you want an automated yet customizable system builder which produces
-    a BusyBox and uClibc based system, try
-    <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">buildroot</a>, which is
-    another project by the maintainer of the uClibc (Erik Andersen).
-    Download the tarball, extract it, unset CC, make.
-    For more instructions, see the website.
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="kernel">Which Linux kernel versions are supported?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    Full functionality requires Linux 2.4.x or better.  (Earlier versions may
-    still work, but are no longer regularly tested.)  A large fraction of the
-    code should run on just about anything.  While the current code is fairly
-    Linux specific, it should be fairly easy to port the majority of the code
-    to support, say, FreeBSD or Solaris, or Mac OS X, or even Windows (if you
-    are into that sort of thing).
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="arch">Which architectures does BusyBox run on?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    BusyBox in general will build on any architecture supported by gcc.
-    Kernel module loading for 2.4 Linux kernels is currently
-    limited to ARM, CRIS, H8/300, x86, ia64, x86_64, m68k, MIPS, PowerPC,
-    S390, SH3/4/5, Sparc, v850e, and x86_64 for 2.4.x kernels.
-</p>
-<p>
-    With 2.6.x kernels, module loading support should work on all architectures.
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="libc">Which C libraries are supported?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    On Linux, BusyBox releases are tested against uClibc (0.9.27 or later) and
-    glibc (2.2 or later).  Both should provide full functionality with busybox,
-    and if you find a bug we want to hear about it.
-</p>
-<p>
-    Linux-libc5 is no longer maintained (and has no known advantages over
-    uClibc), dietlibc is known to have numerous unfixed bugs, and klibc is
-    missing too many features to build BusyBox.  If you require a small C
-    library for Linux, the busybox developers recommend uClibc.
-</p>
-<p>
-    Some BusyBox applets have been built and run under a combination
-    of newlib and libgloss (see
-    <a href="http://www.busybox.net/lists/busybox/2005-March/013759.html">this thread</a>).
-    This is still experimental, but may be supported in a future release.
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="commercial">Can I include BusyBox as part of the software on my device?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    Yes.  As long as you <a href="http://busybox.net/license.html">fully comply
-    with the generous terms of the GPL BusyBox license</a> you can ship BusyBox
-    as part of the software on your device.
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="external">Where can I find other small utilities since busybox
-	does not include the features i want?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-	we maintain such a <a href="tinyutils.html">list</a> on this site!
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="demanding">I demand that you to add &lt;favorite feature&gt; right now!   How come you don't answer all my questions on the mailing list instantly?  I demand that you help me with all of my problems <em>Right Now</em>!</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    You have not paid us a single cent and yet you still have the product of
-    many years of our work.  We are not your slaves!  We work on BusyBox
-    because we find it useful and interesting.  If you go off flaming us, we
-    will ignore you.
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="helpme">I need help with BusyBox!  What should I do?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    If you find that you need help with BusyBox, you can ask for help on the
-    BusyBox mailing list at busybox@busybox.net.</p>
-
-<p> In addition to the mailing list, Erik Andersen (andersee), Manuel Nova
-    (mjn3), Rob Landley (landley), Mike Frysinger (SpanKY),
-    Bernhard Reutner-Fischer (blindvt), and other long-time BusyBox developers
-    are known to hang out on the uClibc IRC channel: #uclibc on
-    irc.freenode.net. There is a
-    <a href="http://ibot.Rikers.org/%23uclibc/">web archive of
-    daily logs of the #uclibc IRC channel</a> going back to 2002.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-    <b>Please do not send private email to Rob, Erik, Manuel, or the other
-    BusyBox contributors asking for private help unless you are planning on
-    paying for consulting services.</b>
-</p>
-
-<p>
-    When we answer questions on the BusyBox mailing list, it helps everyone
-    since people with similar problems in the future will be able to get help
-    by searching the mailing list archives.  Private help is reserved as a paid
-    service.  If you need to use private communication, or if you are serious
-    about getting timely assistance with BusyBox, you should seriously consider
-    paying for consulting services.
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="contracts">I need you to add &lt;favorite feature&gt;!  Are the BusyBox developers willing to be paid in order to fix bugs or add in &lt;favorite feature&gt;?  Are you willing to provide support contracts?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    Yes we are.  The easy way to sponsor a new feature is to post an offer on
-    the mailing list to see who's interested.  You can also email the project's
-    maintainer and ask them to recommend someone.
-</p>
-

-<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="bugs">I think I found a bug in BusyBox!  What should I do?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    If you simply need help with using or configuring BusyBox, please submit a
-    detailed description of your problem to the BusyBox mailing list at <a
-    href="mailto:busybox@busybox.net">busybox@busybox.net</a>.
-    Please do not send email to individual developers asking
-    for private help unless you are planning on paying for consulting services.
-    When we answer questions on the BusyBox mailing list, it helps everyone,
-    while private answers help only you...
-</p>
-
-<p>
-    Bug reports and new feature patches sometimes get lost when posted to the
-    mailing list, because the developers of BusyBox are busy people and have
-    only so much they can keep in their brains at a time.   You can post a
-    polite reminder after 2-3 days without offending anybody.  If that doesn't
-    result in a solution, please use the
-    <a href="https://bugs.busybox.net/">BusyBox Bug
-    and Patch Tracking System</a> to submit a detailed explanation and we'll
-    get to it as soon as we can.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-    Note that bugs entered into the bug system without being mentioned on the
-    mailing list first may languish there for months before anyone even notices
-    them.  We generally go through the bug system when preparing for new
-    development releases, to see what fell through the cracks while we were
-    off writing new features.  (It's a fast/unreliable vs slow/reliable thing.
-    Saves retransits, but the latency sucks.)
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="backporting">I'm using an ancient version from the dawn of time and something's broken.  Can you backport fixes for free?</a></h2>
-
-<p>Variants of this one get asked a lot.</p>
-
-<p>The purpose of the BusyBox mailing list is to develop and improve BusyBox,
-and we're happy to respond to our users' needs.  But if you're coming to the
-list for free tech support we're going to ask you to upgrade to a current
-version before we try to diagnose your problem.</p>
-
-<p>If you're building BusyBox 0.50 with uClibc 0.9.19 and gcc 1.27 there's a
-fairly large chance that whatever problem you're seeing has already been fixed.
-To get that fix, all you have to do is upgrade to a newer version.  If you
-don't at least _try_ that, you're wasting our time.</p>
-
-<p>The volunteers are happy to fix any bugs you point out in the current
-versions because doing so helps everybody and makes the project better.  We
-want to make the current version work for you.  But diagnosing, debugging, and
-backporting fixes to old versions isn't something we do for free, because it
-doesn't help anybody but you.  The cost of volunteer tech support is using a
-reasonably current version of the project.</p>
-
-<p>If you don't want to upgrade, you have the complete source code and thus
-the ability to fix it yourself, or hire a consultant to do it for you.  If you
-got your version from a vendor who still supports the older version, they can
-help you.  But there are limits as to what the volunteers will feel obliged to
-do for you.</p>
-
-<p>As a rule of thumb, volunteers will generally answer polite questions about
-a given version for about three years after its release before it's so old
-we don't remember the answer off the top of our head.  And if you want us to
-put any _effort_ into tracking it down, we want you to put in a little effort
-of your own by confirming it's still a problem with the current version.  It's
-also hard for us to fix a problem of yours if we can't reproduce it because
-we don't have any systems running an environment that old.</p>
-
-<p>A consultant will happily set up a special environment just to reproduce
-your problem, and you can always ask on the list if any of the developers
-have consulting rates.</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="init">Busybox init isn't working!</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    Init is the first program that runs, so it might be that no programs are
-    working on your new system because of a problem with your cross-compiler,
-    kernel, console settings, shared libraries, root filesystem...  To rule all
-    that out, first build a statically linked version of the following "hello
-    world" program with your cross compiler toolchain:
-</p>
-<pre>
-#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
-
-int main(int argc, char *argv)
-{
-  printf("Hello world!\n");
-  sleep(999999999);
-}
-</pre>
-
-<p>
-    Now try to boot your device with an "init=" argument pointing to your
-    hello world program.  Did you see the hello world message?  Until you
-    do, don't bother messing with busybox init.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-    Once you've got it working statically linked, try getting it to work
-    dynamically linked.  Then read the FAQ entry <a href="#build_system">How
-    do I build a BusyBox-based system?</a>, and the
-    <a href="/downloads/BusyBox.html#item_init">documentation for BusyBox
-    init</a>.
-</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="sed">I can't configure busybox on my system.</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    Configuring Busybox depends on a recent version of sed.  Older
-    distributions (Red Hat 7.2, Debian 3.0) may not come with a
-    usable version.  Luckily BusyBox can use its own sed to configure itself,
-    although this leads to a bit of a chicken and egg problem.
-    You can work around this by hand-configuring busybox to build with just
-    sed, then putting that sed in your path to configure the rest of busybox
-    with, like so:
-</p>
-
-<pre>
-  tar xvjf sources/busybox-x.x.x.tar.bz2
-  cd busybox-x.x.x
-  make allnoconfig
-  make include/bb_config.h
-  echo "CONFIG_SED=y" >> .config
-  echo "#undef ENABLE_SED" >> include/bb_config.h
-  echo "#define ENABLE_SED 1" >> include/bb_config.h
-  make
-  mv busybox sed
-  export PATH=`pwd`:"$PATH"
-</pre>
-
-<p>Then you can run "make defconfig" or "make menuconfig" normally.</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="job_control">Why do I keep getting "sh: can't access tty; job control turned off" errors?  Why doesn't Control-C work within my shell?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-    Job control will be turned off since your shell can not obtain a controlling
-    terminal.  This typically happens when you run your shell on /dev/console.
-    The kernel will not provide a controlling terminal on the /dev/console
-    device.  Your should run your shell on a normal tty such as tty1 or ttyS0
-    and everything will work perfectly.  If you <em>REALLY</em> want your shell
-    to run on /dev/console, then you can hack your kernel (if you are into that
-    sortof thing) by changing drivers/char/tty_io.c to change the lines where
-    it sets "noctty = 1;" to instead set it to "0".  I recommend you instead
-    run your shell on a real console...

-<h2><a name="tz">How do I change the time zone in busybox?</a></h2>

-smallest executable size we can manage.  We also want to have the simplest
-and cleanest implementation we can manage, be <a href="#standards">standards
-compliant</a>, minimize run-time memory usage (heap and stack), run fast, and
-take over the world.</p>

-<hr />
-<h2><a name="design">What is the design of busybox?</a></h2>
-
-<p>Busybox is like a swiss army knife: one thing with many functions.
-The busybox executable can act like many different programs depending on
-the name used to invoke it.  Normal practice is to create a bunch of symlinks
-pointing to the busybox binary, each of which triggers a different busybox
-function.  (See <a href="FAQ.html#getting_started">getting started</a> in the
-FAQ for more information on usage, and <a href="BusyBox.html">the
-busybox documentation</a> for a list of symlink names and what they do.)
-
-<p>The "one binary to rule them all" approach is primarily for size reasons: a
-single multi-purpose executable is smaller then many small files could be.
-This way busybox only has one set of ELF headers, it can easily share code
-between different apps even when statically linked, it has better packing
-efficiency by avoding gaps between files or compression dictionary resets,
-and so on.</p>
-
-<p>Work is underway on new options such as "make standalone" to build separate
-binaries for each applet, and a "libbb.so" to make the busybox common code
-available as a shared library.  Neither is ready yet at the time of this
-writing.</p>
-
-<a name="source"></a>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="source_applets">The applet directories</a></h2>
-
-<p>The directory "applets" contains the busybox startup code (applets.c and
-busybox.c), and several subdirectories containing the code for the individual
-applets.</p>
-
-<p>Busybox execution starts with the main() function in applets/busybox.c,
-which sets the global variable applet_name to argv[0] and calls
-run_applet_and_exit() in applets/applets.c.  That uses the applets[] array
-(defined in include/busybox.h and filled out in include/applets.h) to
-transfer control to the appropriate APPLET_main() function (such as
-cat_main() or sed_main()).  The individual applet takes it from there.</p>
-
-<p>This is why calling busybox under a different name triggers different
-functionality: main() looks up argv[0] in applets[] to get a function pointer
-to APPLET_main().</p>
-
-<p>Busybox applets may also be invoked through the multiplexor applet
-"busybox" (see busybox_main() in libbb/appletlib.c), and through the
-standalone shell (grep for STANDALONE_SHELL in applets/shell/*.c).
-See <a href="FAQ.html#getting_started">getting started</a> in the
-FAQ for more information on these alternate usage mechanisms, which are
-just different ways to reach the relevant APPLET_main() function.</p>
-
-<p>The applet subdirectories (archival, console-tools, coreutils,
-debianutils, e2fsprogs, editors, findutils, init, loginutils, miscutils,
-modutils, networking, procps, shell, sysklogd, and util-linux) correspond
-to the configuration sub-menus in menuconfig.  Each subdirectory contains the
-code to implement the applets in that sub-menu, as well as a Config.in
-file defining that configuration sub-menu (with dependencies and help text
-for each applet), and the makefile segment (Makefile.in) for that
-subdirectory.</p>
-
-<p>The run-time --help is stored in usage_messages[], which is initialized at
-the start of applets/applets.c and gets its help text from usage.h.  During the
-build this help text is also used to generate the BusyBox documentation (in
-html, txt, and man page formats) in the docs directory.  See
-<a href="#adding">adding an applet to busybox</a> for more
-information.</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="source_libbb"><b>libbb</b></a></h2>
-
-<p>Most non-setup code shared between busybox applets lives in the libbb
-directory.  It's a mess that evolved over the years without much auditing
-or cleanup.  For anybody looking for a great project to break into busybox
-development with, documenting libbb would be both incredibly useful and good
-experience.</p>
-
-<p>Common themes in libbb include allocation functions that test
-for failure and abort the program with an error message so the caller doesn't
-have to test the return value (xmalloc(), xstrdup(), etc), wrapped versions
-of open(), close(), read(), and write() that test for their own failures
-and/or retry automatically, linked list management functions (llist.c),
-command line argument parsing (getopt32.c), and a whole lot more.</p>

-<hr />
-<h2><a name="optimize">I want to make busybox even smaller, how do I go about it?</a></h2>
-
-<p>
-	To conserve bytes it's good to know where they're being used, and the
-	size of the final executable isn't always a reliable indicator of
-	the size of the components (since various structures are rounded up,
-	so a small change may not even be visible by itself, but many small
-	savings add up).
-</p>
-
-<p>     The busybox Makefile builds two versions of busybox, one of which
-        (busybox_unstripped) has extra information that various analysis tools
-        can use.  (This has nothing to do with CONFIG_DEBUG, leave that off
-        when trying to optimize for size.)
-</p>
-
-<p>     The <b>"make bloatcheck"</b> option uses Matt Mackall's bloat-o-meter
-        script to compare two versions of busybox (busybox_unstripped vs
-        busybox_old), and report which symbols changed size and by how much.
-        To use it, first build a base version with <b>"make baseline"</b>.
-        (This creates busybox_old, which should have the original sizes for
-        comparison purposes.)  Then build the new version with your changes
-        and run "make bloatcheck" to see the size differences from the old
-        version.
-</p>
-<p>
-        The first line of output has totals: how many symbols were added or
-        removed, how many symbols grew or shrank, the number of bytes added
-        and number of bytes removed by these changes, and finally the total
-        number of bytes difference between the two files.  The remaining
-        lines show each individual symbol, the old and new sizes, and the
-        increase or decrease in size (which results are sorted by).
-</p>
-<p>
-	The <b>"make sizes"</b> option produces raw symbol size information for
-        busybox_unstripped.  This is the output from the "nm --size-sort"
-        command (see "man nm" for more information), and is the information
-        bloat-o-meter parses to produce the comparison report above.  For
-        defconfig, this is a good way to find the largest symbols in the tree
-        (which is a good place to start when trying to shrink the code).  To
-        take a closer look at individual applets, configure busybox with just
-        one applet (run "make allnoconfig" and then switch on a single applet
-        with menuconfig), and then use "make sizes" to see the size of that
-        applet's components.
-</p>
-<p>
-        The "showasm" command (in the scripts directory) produces an assembly
-        dump of a function, providing a closer look at what changed.  Try
-        "scripts/showasm busybox_unstripped" to list available symbols, and
-        "scripts/showasm busybox_unstripped symbolname" to see the assembly
-        for a sepecific symbol.

-<h2><a name="adding">Adding an applet to busybox</a></h2>
-
-<p>To add a new applet to busybox, first pick a name for the applet and
-a corresponding CONFIG_NAME.  Then do this:</p>
-
-<ul>
-<li>Figure out where in the busybox source tree your applet best fits,
-and put your source code there.  Be sure to use APPLET_main() instead
-of main(), where APPLET is the name of your applet.</li>
-
-<li>Add your applet to the relevant Config.in file (which file you add
-it to determines where it shows up in "make menuconfig").  This uses
-the same general format as the linux kernel's configuration system.</li>
-
-<li>Add your applet to the relevant Makefile.in file (in the same
-directory as the Config.in you chose), using the existing entries as a
-template and the same CONFIG symbol as you used for Config.in.  (Don't
-forget "needlibm" or "needcrypt" if your applet needs libm or
-libcrypt.)</li>
-
-<li>Add your applet to "include/applets.h", using one of the existing
-entries as a template.  (Note: this is in alphabetical order.  Applets
-are found via binary search, and if you add an applet out of order it
-won't work.)</li>
-
-<li>Add your applet's runtime help text to "include/usage.h".  You need
-at least appname_trivial_usage (the minimal help text, always included
-in the busybox binary when this applet is enabled) and appname_full_usage
-(extra help text included in the busybox binary with
-CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE is enabled), or it won't compile.
-The other two help entry types (appname_example_usage and
-appname_notes_usage) are optional.  They don't take up space in the binary,
-but instead show up in the generated documentation (BusyBox.html,
-BusyBox.txt, and the man page BusyBox.1).</li>
-
-<li>Run menuconfig, switch your applet on, compile, test, and fix the
-bugs.  Be sure to try both "allyesconfig" and "allnoconfig" (and
-"allbareconfig" if relevant).</li>
-
-</ul>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="standards">What standards does busybox adhere to?</a></h2>
-
-<p>The standard we're paying attention to is the "Shell and Utilities"
-portion of the <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/">Open
-Group Base Standards</a> (also known as the Single Unix Specification version
-3 or SUSv3).  Note that paying attention isn't necessarily the same thing as
-following it.</p>
-
-<p>SUSv3 doesn't even mention things like init, mount, tar, or losetup, nor
-commonly used options like echo's '-e' and '-n', or sed's '-i'.  Busybox is
-driven by what real users actually need, not the fact the standard believes
-we should implement ed or sccs.  For size reasons, we're unlikely to include
-much internationalization support beyond UTF-8, and on top of all that, our
-configuration menu lets developers chop out features to produce smaller but
-very non-standard utilities.</p>
-
-<p>Also, Busybox is aimed primarily at Linux.  Unix standards are interesting
-because Linux tries to adhere to them, but portability to dozens of platforms
-is only interesting in terms of offering a restricted feature set that works
-everywhere, not growing dozens of platform-specific extensions.  Busybox
-should be portable to all hardware platforms Linux supports, and any other
-similar operating systems that are easy to do and won't require much
-maintenance.</p>
-
-<p>In practice, standards compliance tends to be a clean-up step once an
-applet is otherwise finished.  When polishing and testing a busybox applet,
-we ensure we have at least the option of full standards compliance, or else
-document where we (intentionally) fall short.</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="portability">Portability.</a></h2>
-
-<p>Busybox is a Linux project, but that doesn't mean we don't have to worry
-about portability.  First of all, there are different hardware platforms,
-different C library implementations, different versions of the kernel and
-build toolchain...  The file "include/platform.h" exists to centralize and
-encapsulate various platform-specific things in one place, so most busybox
-code doesn't have to care where it's running.</p>
-
-<p>To start with, Linux runs on dozens of hardware platforms.  We try to test
-each release on x86, x86-64, arm, power pc, and mips.  (Since qemu can handle
-all of these, this isn't that hard.)  This means we have to care about a number
-of portability issues like endianness, word size, and alignment, all of which
-belong in platform.h.  That header handles conditional #includes and gives
-us macros we can use in the rest of our code.  At some point in the future
-we might grow a platform.c, possibly even a platform subdirectory.  As long
-as the applets themselves don't have to care.</p>
-
-<p>On a related note, we made the "default signedness of char varies" problem
-go away by feeding the compiler -funsigned-char.  This gives us consistent
-behavior on all platforms, and defaults to 8-bit clean text processing (which
-gets us halfway to UTF-8 support).  NOMMU support is less easily separated
-(see the tips section later in this document), but we're working on it.</p>
-
-<p>Another type of portability is build environments: we unapologetically use
-a number of gcc and glibc extensions (as does the Linux kernel), but these have
-been picked up by packages like uClibc, TCC, and Intel's C Compiler.  As for
-gcc, we take advantage of newer compiler optimizations to get the smallest
-possible size, but we also regression test against an older build environment
-using the Red Hat 9 image at "http://busybox.net/downloads/qemu".  This has a
-2.4 kernel, gcc 3.2, make 3.79.1, and glibc 2.3, and is the oldest
-build/deployment environment we still put any effort into maintaining.  (If
-anyone takes an interest in older kernels you're welcome to submit patches,
-but the effort would probably be better spent
-<a href="http://www.selenic.com/linux-tiny/">trimming
-down the 2.6 kernel</a>.)  Older gcc versions than that are uninteresting since
-we now use c99 features, although
-<a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc/">tcc</a> might be worth a
-look.</p>
-
-<p>We also test busybox against the current release of uClibc.  Older versions
-of uClibc aren't very interesting (they were buggy, and uClibc wasn't really
-usable as a general-purpose C library before version 0.9.26 anyway).</p>
-
-<p>Other unix implementations are mostly uninteresting, since Linux binaries
-have become the new standard for portable Unix programs.  Specifically,
-the ubiquity of Linux was cited as the main reason the Intel Binary
-Compatability Standard 2 died, by the standards group organized to name a
-successor to ibcs2: <a href="http://www.telly.org/86open/">the 86open
-project</a>.  That project disbanded in 1999 with the endorsement of an
-existing standard: Linux ELF binaries.  Since then, the major players at the
-time (such as <a
-href="http://www-03.ibm.com/servers/aix/products/aixos/linux/index.html">AIX</a>, <a
-href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/ds/linux_interop.jsp#3">Solaris</a>, and
-<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2000/03/17/linuxapps.html">FreeBSD</a>)
-have all either grown Linux support or folded.</p>
-
-<p>The major exceptions are newcomer MacOS X, some embedded environments
-(such as newlib+libgloss) which provide a posix environment but not a full
-Linux environment, and environments like Cygwin that provide only partial Linux
-emulation.  Also, some embedded Linux systems run a Linux kernel but amputate
-things like the /proc directory to save space.</p>
-
-<p>Supporting these systems is largely a question of providing a clean subset
-of BusyBox's functionality -- whichever applets can easily be made to
-work in that environment.  Annotating the configuration system to
-indicate which applets require which prerequisites (such as procfs) is
-also welcome.  Other efforts to support these systems (swapping #include
-files to build in different environments, adding adapter code to platform.h,
-adding more extensive special-case supporting infrastructure such as mount's
-legacy mtab support) are handled on a case-by-case basis.  Support that can be
-cleanly hidden in platform.h is reasonably attractive, and failing that
-support that can be cleanly separated into a separate conditionally compiled
-file is at least worth a look.  Special-case code in the body of an applet is
-something we're trying to avoid.</p>

-<h2><a name="tips">Programming tips and tricks.</a></h2>
-
-<p>Various things busybox uses that aren't particularly well documented
-elsewhere.</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="tips_encrypted_passwords">Encrypted Passwords</a></h2>
-
-<p>Password fields in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow are in a special format.
-If the first character isn't '$', then it's an old DES style password.  If
-the first character is '$' then the password is actually three fields
-separated by '$' characters:</p>
-<pre>
-  <b>$type$salt$encrypted_password</b>
-</pre>
-
-<p>The "type" indicates which encryption algorithm to use: 1 for MD5 and 2 for SHA1.</p>
-
-<p>The "salt" is a bunch of ramdom characters (generally 8) the encryption
-algorithm uses to perturb the password in a known and reproducible way (such
-as by appending the random data to the unencrypted password, or combining
-them with exclusive or).  Salt is randomly generated when setting a password,
-and then the same salt value is re-used when checking the password.  (Salt is
-thus stored unencrypted.)</p>
-
-<p>The advantage of using salt is that the same cleartext password encrypted
-with a different salt value produces a different encrypted value.
-If each encrypted password uses a different salt value, an attacker is forced
-to do the cryptographic math all over again for each password they want to
-check.  Without salt, they could simply produce a big dictionary of commonly
-used passwords ahead of time, and look up each password in a stolen password
-file to see if it's a known value.  (Even if there are billions of possible
-passwords in the dictionary, checking each one is just a binary search against
-a file only a few gigabytes long.)  With salt they can't even tell if two
-different users share the same password without guessing what that password
-is and decrypting it.  They also can't precompute the attack dictionary for
-a specific password until they know what the salt value is.</p>
-
-<p>The third field is the encrypted password (plus the salt).  For md5 this
-is 22 bytes.</p>
-
-<p>The busybox function to handle all this is pw_encrypt(clear, salt) in
-"libbb/pw_encrypt.c".  The first argument is the clear text password to be
-encrypted, and the second is a string in "$type$salt$password" format, from
-which the "type" and "salt" fields will be extracted to produce an encrypted
-value.  (Only the first two fields are needed, the third $ is equivalent to
-the end of the string.)  The return value is an encrypted password in
-/etc/passwd format, with all three $ separated fields.  It's stored in
-a static buffer, 128 bytes long.</p>
-
-<p>So when checking an existing password, if pw_encrypt(text,
-old_encrypted_password) returns a string that compares identical to
-old_encrypted_password, you've got the right password.  When setting a new
-password, generate a random 8 character salt string, put it in the right
-format with sprintf(buffer, "$%c$%s", type, salt), and feed buffer as the
-second argument to pw_encrypt(text,buffer).</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="tips_vfork">Fork and vfork</a></h2>
-
-<p>On systems that haven't got a Memory Management Unit, fork() is unreasonably
-expensive to implement (and sometimes even impossible), so a less capable
-function called vfork() is used instead.  (Using vfork() on a system with an
-MMU is like pounding a nail with a wrench.  Not the best tool for the job, but
-it works.)</p>
-
-<p>Busybox hides the difference between fork() and vfork() in
-libbb/bb_fork_exec.c.  If you ever want to fork and exec, use bb_fork_exec()
-(which returns a pid and takes the same arguments as execve(), although in
-this case envp can be NULL) and don't worry about it.  This description is
-here in case you want to know why that does what it does.</p>
-
-<p>Implementing fork() depends on having a Memory Management Unit.  With an
-MMU then you can simply set up a second set of page tables and share the
-physical memory via copy-on-write.  So a fork() followed quickly by exec()
-only copies a few pages of the parent's memory, just the ones it changes
-before freeing them.</p>
-
-<p>With a very primitive MMU (using a base pointer plus length instead of page
-tables, which can provide virtual addresses and protect processes from each
-other, but no copy on write) you can still implement fork.  But it's
-unreasonably expensive, because you have to copy all the parent process'
-memory into the new process (which could easily be several megabytes per fork).
-And you have to do this even though that memory gets freed again as soon as the
-exec happens.  (This is not just slow and a waste of space but causes memory
-usage spikes that can easily cause the system to run out of memory.)</p>
-
-<p>Without even a primitive MMU, you have no virtual addresses.  Every process
-can reach out and touch any other process' memory, because all pointers are to
-physical addresses with no protection.  Even if you copy a process' memory to
-new physical addresses, all of its pointers point to the old objects in the
-old process.  (Searching through the new copy's memory for pointers and
-redirect them to the new locations is not an easy problem.)</p>
-
-<p>So with a primitive or missing MMU, fork() is just not a good idea.</p>
-
-<p>In theory, vfork() is just a fork() that writeably shares the heap and stack
-rather than copying it (so what one process writes the other one sees).  In
-practice, vfork() has to suspend the parent process until the child does exec,
-at which point the parent wakes up and resumes by returning from the call to
-vfork().  All modern kernel/libc combinations implement vfork() to put the
-parent to sleep until the child does its exec.  There's just no other way to
-make it work: the parent has to know the child has done its exec() or exit()
-before it's safe to return from the function it's in, so it has to block
-until that happens.  In fact without suspending the parent there's no way to
-even store separate copies of the return value (the pid) from the vfork() call
-itself: both assignments write into the same memory location.</p>
-
-<p>One way to understand (and in fact implement) vfork() is this: imagine
-the parent does a setjmp and then continues on (pretending to be the child)
-until the exec() comes around, then the _exec_ does the actual fork, and the
-parent does a longjmp back to the original vfork call and continues on from
-there.  (It thus becomes obvious why the child can't return, or modify
-local variables it doesn't want the parent to see changed when it resumes.)
-
-<p>Note a common mistake: the need for vfork doesn't mean you can't have two
-processes running at the same time.  It means you can't have two processes
-sharing the same memory without stomping all over each other.  As soon as
-the child calls exec(), the parent resumes.</p>
-
-<p>If the child's attempt to call exec() fails, the child should call _exit()
-rather than a normal exit().  This avoids any atexit() code that might confuse
-the parent.  (The parent should never call _exit(), only a vforked child that
-failed to exec.)</p>
-
-<p>(Now in theory, a nommu system could just copy the _stack_ when it forks
-(which presumably is much shorter than the heap), and leave the heap shared.
-Even with no MMU at all
-In practice, you've just wound up in a multi-threaded situation and you can't
-do a malloc() or free() on your heap without freeing the other process' memory
-(and if you don't have the proper locking for being threaded, corrupting the
-heap if both of you try to do it at the same time and wind up stomping on
-each other while traversing the free memory lists).  The thing about vfork is
-that it's a big red flag warning "there be dragons here" rather than
-something subtle and thus even more dangerous.)</p>
-
-<hr />
-<h2><a name="tips_sort_read">Short reads and writes</a></h2>
-
-<p>Busybox has special functions, bb_full_read() and bb_full_write(), to
-check that all the data we asked for got read or written.  Is this a real
-world consideration?  Try the following:</p>
-
-<pre>while true; do echo hello; sleep 1; done | tee out.txt</pre>
-
-<p>If tee is implemented with bb_full_read(), tee doesn't display output
-in real time but blocks until its entire input buffer (generally a couple
-kilobytes) is read, then displays it all at once.  In that case, we _want_
-the short read, for user interface reasons.  (Note that read() should never
-return 0 unless it has hit the end of input, and an attempt to write 0
-bytes should be ignored by the OS.)</p>
-
-<p>As for short writes, play around with two processes piping data to each
-other on the command line (cat bigfile | gzip &gt; out.gz) and suspend and
-resume a few times (ctrl-z to suspend, "fg" to resume).  The writer can
-experience short writes, which are especially dangerous because if you don't
-notice them you'll discard data.  They can also happen when a system is under
-load and a fast process is piping to a slower one.  (Such as an xterm waiting
-on x11 when the scheduler decides X is being a CPU hog with all that
-text console scrolling...)</p>
-
-<p>So will data always be read from the far end of a pipe at the
-same chunk sizes it was written in?  Nope.  Don't rely on that.  For one
-counterexample, see <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc896.html">rfc 896
-for Nagle's algorithm</a>, which waits a fraction of a second or so before
-sending out small amounts of data through a TCP/IP connection in case more
-data comes in that can be merged into the same packet.  (In case you were
-wondering why action games that use TCP/IP set TCP_NODELAY to lower the latency
-on their their sockets, now you know.)</p>

-<hr />
-<h2><a name="tips_memory">Memory used by relocatable code, PIC, and static linking.</a></h2>
-
-<p>The downside of standard dynamic linking is that it results in self-modifying
-code.  Although each executable's pages are mmaped() into a process' address
-space from the executable file and are thus naturally shared between processes
-out of the page cache, the library loader (ld-linux.so.2 or ld-uClibc.so.0)
-writes to these pages to supply addresses for relocatable symbols.  This
-dirties the pages, triggering copy-on-write allocation of new memory for each
-processes' dirtied pages.</p>
-
-<p>One solution to this is Position Independent Code (PIC), a way of linking
-a file so all the relocations are grouped together.  This dirties fewer
-pages (often just a single page) for each process' relocations.  The down
-side is this results in larger executables, which take up more space on disk
-(and a correspondingly larger space in memory).  But when many copies of the
-same program are running, PIC dynamic linking trades a larger disk footprint
-for a smaller memory footprint, by sharing more pages.</p>
-
-<p>A third solution is static linking.  A statically linked program has no
-relocations, and thus the entire executable is shared between all running
-instances.  This tends to have a significantly larger disk footprint, but
-on a system with only one or two executables, shared libraries aren't much
-of a win anyway.</p>
-
-<p>You can tell the glibc linker to display debugging information about its
-relocations with the environment variable "LD_DEBUG".  Try
-"LD_DEBUG=help /bin/true" for a list of commands.  Learning to interpret
-"LD_DEBUG=statistics cat /proc/self/statm" could be interesting.</p>

-<blockquote>
-<p>Dynamic linking (without fixed load addresses) fundamentally requires
-at least one dirty page per dso that uses symbols. Making calls (but
-never taking the address explicitly) to functions within the same dso
-does not require a dirty page by itself, but will with ELF unless you
-use -Bsymbolic or hidden symbols when linking.</p>
-
-<p>ELF uses significant additional stack space for the kernel to pass all
-the ELF data structures to the newly created process image. These are
-located above the argument list and environment. This normally adds 1
-dirty page to the process size.</p>
-
-<p>The ELF dynamic linker has its own data segment, adding one or more
-dirty pages. I believe it also performs relocations on itself.</p>
-
-<p>The ELF dynamic linker makes significant dynamic allocations to manage
-the global symbol table and the loaded dso's. This data is never
-freed. It will be needed again if libdl is used, so unconditionally
-freeing it is not possible, but normal programs do not use libdl. Of
-course with glibc all programs use libdl (due to nsswitch) so the
-issue was never addressed.</p>
-
-<p>ELF also has the issue that segments are not page-aligned on disk.
-This saves up to 4k on disk, but at the expense of using an additional
-dirty page in most cases, due to a large portion of the first data
-page being filled with a duplicate copy of the last text page.</p>
-
-<p>The above is just a partial list of the tiny memory penalties of ELF
-dynamic linking, which eventually add up to quite a bit. The smallest
-I've been able to get a process down to is 8 dirty pages, and the
-above factors seem to mostly account for it (but some were difficult
-to measure).</p>

-<h2><a name="tips_kernel_headers"></a>Including kernel headers</h2>
-
-<p>The &quot;linux&quot; or &quot;asm&quot; directories of /usr/include
-contain Linux kernel
-headers, so that the C library can talk directly to the Linux kernel.  In
-a perfect world, applications shouldn't include these headers directly, but
-we don't live in a perfect world.</p>
-
-<p>For example, Busybox's losetup code wants linux/loop.c because nothing else
-#defines the structures to call the kernel's loopback device setup ioctls.
-Attempts to cut and paste the information into a local busybox header file
-proved incredibly painful, because portions of the loop_info structure vary by
-architecture, namely the type __kernel_dev_t has different sizes on alpha,
-arm, x86, and so on.  Meaning we either #include &lt;linux/posix_types.h&gt; or
-we hardwire #ifdefs to check what platform we're building on and define this
-type appropriately for every single hardware architecture supported by
-Linux, which is simply unworkable.</p>
-
-<p>This is aside from the fact that the relevant type defined in
-posix_types.h was renamed to __kernel_old_dev_t during the 2.5 series, so
-to cut and paste the structure into our header we have to #include
-&lt;linux/version.h&gt; to figure out which name to use.  (What we actually
-do is
-check if we're building on 2.6, and if so just use the new 64 bit structure
-instead to avoid the rename entirely.)  But we still need the version
-check, since 2.4 didn't have the 64 bit structure.</p>
-
-<p>The BusyBox developers spent <u>two years</u> trying to figure
-out a clean way to do all this.  There isn't one.  The losetup in the
-util-linux package from kernel.org isn't doing it cleanly either, they just
-hide the ugliness by nesting #include files.  Their mount/loop.h
-#includes &quot;my_dev_t.h&quot;, which #includes &lt;linux/posix_types.h&gt;
-and &lt;linux/version.h&gt; just like we do.  There simply is no alternative.
-</p>
-
-<p>Just because directly #including kernel headers is sometimes
-unavoidable doesn't me we should include them when there's a better
-way to do it.  However, block copying information out of the kernel headers
-is not a better way.</p>

-<h3>BusyBox: The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux</h3>
-
-<p>BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
-small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you
-usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox
-generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however,
-the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave
-very much like their GNU counterparts.  BusyBox provides a fairly complete
-environment for any small or embedded system.</p>
-
-<p>BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in
-mind. It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude
-commands (or features) at compile time. This makes it easy to customize
-your embedded systems. To create a working system, just add some device
-nodes in /dev, a few configuration files in /etc, and a Linux kernel.</p>
-
-<p>BusyBox is maintained by
-<a href="mailto:vda.linux@googlemail.com">Denys Vlasenko</a>,
-and licensed under the <a href="license.html">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
-version 2.</p>

-<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
-<p>
-<ul>
-<li>Send several <em>sensible</em> patches to the <a href="lists.html" title="Mailing list">Mailing list</a>.</li>
-<li>Help <em>users</em>, answer their questions, guide them, be helpful and friendly.</li>
-<li>Repeat above.
-</ul>
-</p>
-<p>
-If you feel comfortable with the above and have proven to continually
-fulfill these requirements, or somebody asks you to apply for write-access
-to the repository who itself is maintainer of a project, then please apply
-for an account (if needed).
-</p>
-<h3>Morris Dancing</h3>
-
-<p>Subversion commit access requires an account on Morris.  The server
-behind busybox.net and uclibc.org.  If you want to be able to commit things to
-Subversion, first contribute some stuff to show you are serious, can handle
-some responsibility, and that your patches don't generally need a lot of
-cleanup.  Then, very nicely ask one of us
-(<a href="mailto:vda.linux@googlemail.com">Denys Vlasenko</a> for primarily BusyBox, or
-<a href="mailto:rep&#46;<literal>dot</>&#46;nop@gmail.com">Bernhard Reutner-Fischer</a> primarily for uClibc)
-for an account.</p>
-
-<p>If you're approved for an account, you'll need to send an email from your
-preferred contact email address with the username you'd like to use when
-committing changes to GIT, and attach a public ssh key to access your account
-with.</p>
-
-<p>If you don't currently have an ssh version 2 DSA key at least 4096 bits
-long, you can generate a key using the command
-<b>ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t dsa</b>
-and hitting enter at the prompts.
-This will create the files <b>~/.ssh/id_dsa</b> and <b>~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</b>
-You must then send the content of 'id_dsa.pub' to me so I can set up your
-account.  (The content of 'id_dsa' should of course be kept secret, anyone
-who has that can access any account that's installed your public key in
-its <b>.ssh/authorized_keys</b> file.)</p>
-
-<p>Note that if you would prefer to keep your communications with us
-private, you can encrypt your email using
-<a href="http://busybox.net/~vda/vda_pubkey.gpg">Denys' public key</a> or
-<a href="http://uClibc.org/~aldot/gpg.asc">Bernhard's public key</a>.
-</p>
-
-<p>Once you are setup with an account, you will need to use your account to
-checkout a copy of BusyBox from GIT:</p>
-
-<p><b>git+ssh://username@git.busybox.net/git/busybox busybox.mine</b></p>
-<p>or</p>
-<p><b>git+ssh://username@git.uClibc.org/git/uClibc uClibc.tmp</b></p>
-
-<p>You must change <em>username</em> to your own username, or omit
-it if it's the same as your local username.</p>
-
-<p>You can then enter the newly checked out project directory, make changes,
-check your changes, diff your changes, revert your changes, and and commit your
-changes using commands such as:</p>
-
-<b><pre>
-git diff
-git format-patch -s
-git status
-git revert <revert-hash>
-EDITOR=vi git commit -s
-git log
-git push -v --thin
-git help
-</pre></b>
-
-<p>For additional detail on how to use
-<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/">GIT</a>, please visit the
-<a href="http://git.or.cz/">GIT overview</a> site.
-You might also want to read online the <a
-href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs">manpages</a>
-or
-<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html">tutorial</a>.
-</p>
-
-<p>A morris account also gives you a personal web page
-(http://busybox.net/~username comes from ~/public_html on morris), and of
-course a shell prompt you can ssh into (as a regular user, root access is
-reserved for folks doing maintenancy stuff only).  But keep in mind an
-account on Morris is a
-priviledge, not a requirement.  Most contributors to busybox and uClibc
-haven't got one, and accounts are handed out to make the project maintainers'
-lives easier, not because &quot;you deserve it&quot;.</p>

-<p>
-<h3><a name="license">BusyBox is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2</a></h3>
-
-<p>BusyBox is licensed under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html#SEC1">the
-GNU General Public License</a> version 2, which is often abbreviated as GPLv2.
-(This is the same license the Linux kernel is under, so you may be somewhat
-familiar with it by now.)</p>
-
-<p>A complete copy of the license text is included in the file LICENSE in
-the BusyBox source code.</p>
-
-<p><a href="products.html">Anyone thinking of shipping BusyBox as part of a
-product</a> should be familiar with the licensing terms under which they are
-allowed to use and distribute BusyBox.  Read the full test of the GPL (either
-through the above link, or in the file LICENSE in the busybox tarball), and
-also read the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">Frequently
-Asked Questions about the GPL</a>.</p>
-
-<p>Basically, if you distribute GPL software the license requires that you also
-distribute the source code to that GPL-licensed software.  So if you distribute
-BusyBox without making the source code to the version you distribute available,
-you violate the license terms, and thus infringe on the copyrights of BusyBox.
-(This requirement applies whether or not you modified BusyBox; either way the
-license terms still apply to you.)  Read the license text for the details.</p>
-
-<h3><a name="version">A note on GPL versions</a></h3>
-
-<p>Version 2 of the GPL is the only version of the GPL which current versions
-of BusyBox may be distributed under.  New code added to the tree is licensed
-GPL version 2, and the project's license is GPL version 2.</p>
-
-<p>Older versions of BusyBox (versions 1.2.2 and earlier, up through about svn
-16112) included variants of the recommended
-&quot;GPL version 2 or (at your option) later versions&quot; boilerplate
-permission grant.  Ancient versions of BusyBox
-(before svn 49) did not specify any version at all, and section 9 of GPLv2
-(the most recent version at that time) says those old versions may be
-redistributed under any version of GPL (including the obsolete V1).  This was
-conceptually similar to a dual license, except that the different licenses were
-different versions of the GPL.</p>
-
-<p>However, BusyBox has apparently always contained chunks of code that were
-licensed under GPL version 2 only.  Examples include applets written by Linus
-Torvalds (util-linux/mkfs_minix.c and util_linux/mkswap.c) which stated they
-&quot;may be redistributed as per the Linux copyright&quot; (which Linus
-clarified in the
-2.4.0-pre8 release announcement in 2000 was GPLv2 only), and Linux kernel code
-copied into libbb/loop.c (after Linus's announcement).  There are probably
-more, because all we used to check was that the code was GPL, not which
-version.  (Before the GPLv3 draft proceedings in 2006, it was a purely
-theoretical issue that didn't come up much.)</p>
-
-<p>To summarize: every version of BusyBox may be distributed under the terms of
-GPL version 2.  New versions (after 1.2.2) may <b>only</b> be distributed under
-GPLv2, not under other versions of the GPL.  Older versions of BusyBox might
-(or might not) be distributable under other versions of the GPL.  If you
-want to use a GPL version other than 2, you should start with one of the old
-versions such as release 1.2.2 or SVN 16112, and do your own homework to
-identify and remove any code that can't be licensed under the GPL version you
-want to use.  New development is all GPLv2.</p>
-
-<h3><a name="enforce">License enforcement</a></h3>
-
-<p>BusyBox's copyrights are enforced by the <a
-href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Law Center</a>
-(you can contact them at gpl@busybox.net), which
-&quot;accepts primary responsibility for enforcement of US copyrights on the
-software... and coordinates international copyright enforcement efforts for
-such works as necessary.&quot;  If you distribute BusyBox in a way that doesn't
-comply with the terms of the license BusyBox is distributed under, expect to
-hear from these guys.  Their entire reason for existing is to do pro-bono
-legal work for free/open source software projects.  (We used to list people who
-violate the BusyBox license in <a href="shame.html">The Hall of Shame</a>,
-but these days we find it much more effective to hand them over to the
-lawyers.)</p>
-
-<p>Our enforcement efforts are aimed at bringing people into compliance with
-the BusyBox license.  Open source software is under a different license from
-proprietary software, but if you violate that license you're still a software
-pirate and the law gives the vendor (us) some big sticks to play with.  We
-don't want monetary awards, injunctions, or to generate bad PR for a company,
-unless that's the only way to get somebody that repeatedly ignores us to comply
-with the license on our code.</p>
-
-<h3><a name="good">A Good Example</a></h3>
-
-<p>These days, <a href="http://www.linksys.com/">Linksys</a> is
-doing a good job at complying with the GPL, they get to be an
-example of how to do things right.  Please take a moment and
-check out what they do with
-<a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&amp;childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;cid=1115416836002&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper">
-distributing the firmware for their WRT54G Router.</a>
-Following their example would be a fine way to ensure that you
-have also fulfilled your licensing obligations.</p>

-	<li>acpid, mkdosfs, tunctl: by Vladimir</li>
-	<li>ftpd: by Adam Tkac (vonsch AT gmail.com)</li>
-	<li>timeout: by Roberto Foglietta</li>
-	<li>ionice: adapted from Linux kernel example by Walter Harms</li>
-	<li>mkpasswd: synonym to cryptpw. mkpasswd is in Debian, OTOH cryptpw was added to busybox earlier. Trying to make both camps happy by making those two applets just aliases. They are command-line compatible</li>
-      </ul>
-
-    <p>Changes since previous release:
-
-    <p>lash and msh are deprecated, please migrate to hush.
-
-    <p>hush had many, many fixes and features added: here documents, arithmetic evaluation, function support, and all this works on NOMMU too, safely, including 100kb-sized `command` and here documents. Here document support, arithmetic evaluation, improved ${var} operations, other fixes are by Mike Frysinger (vapier AT gentoo.org).

-    iproute, mdev, mkswap, msh, nameif, stty, test, zcip.</p>
-    <p>hush has `command` expansion re-enabled for NOMMU, although it is

-    The plan is to make this less likely to bite people in future versions.</p>

-    <p>lash is deleted from this release. hush can be configured down to almost
-       the same size, but it is significantly less buggy. It even works
-       on NOMMU machines (interactive mode and backticks are not working on NOMMU,
-       though). "lash" applet is still available, but it runs hush.
-
-    <p>init has some changes in this release, please report if it causes

-    label. Please help making 1.6.1 stable by testing 1.6.0.</p>
-    <p>Note that hush shell had many changes and (hopefully) is much improved now,
-    but there is a possibility that it regressed in some obscure cases. Please
-    report any such cases.</p>
-    <p>lash users please note: lash is going to be deprecated in busybox 1.7.0
-    and removed in the more distant future. Please migrate to hush.</p>

-    (<a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/fixes-1.4.0/">patches</a>)</p>
-
-    <p>Since this is a x.x.0 release, it probably is a bit less "stable"
-    than usual.</p>
-    <p>Changes since previous release:
-    <ul>
-    <li>e2fsprogs are mostly removed from busybox. Some smaller parts remain,
-    the rest of it sits disabled in e2fsprogs/old_e2fsprogs/*, because
-    it's too bloated. Really. I'm afraid it's about the only way we can
-    ever get e2fsprogs cleaned up.
-    <li>less: many improvements. Now can display binary files
-    (although I expect it to have trouble with displays where 8bit chars
-    don't have 1-to-1 char/glyph relationship). Regexp search is not buggy
-    anymore. Less does not read entire input up-front. Reads input
-    as it appears (yay!). Works rather nice as man pager. I recommend it
-    for general use now.
-    <li>IPv6: generic support is in place, many networking applets are
-    upgraded to be IPv6 capable. Probably some work remains, but it is
-    already much better than what we had previously.
-    <li>arp: new applet (thanks to Eric Spakman).
-    <li>fakeidentd: non-forking standalone server part was taking ~90%
-    of the applet. Factored it out (in fact, rewrote it).
-    <li>syslogd: mostly rewritten.
-    <li>decompress_unzip, gzip: sanitized a bit.
-    <li>sed: better hadling of NULs
-    <li>httpd: stop adding our own "Content-type:" to CGI output
-    <li>chown: user.grp works again.
-    <li>minor bugfixes to: passwd, date, tftp, start_stop_daemon, tar,
-    ps, ifupdown, time, su, stty, awk, ping[6], sort,...
-    </ul>

-    <p>This release has CONFIG_DESKTOP option which enables features
-    needed for busybox usage on desktop machine. For example, find, chmod
-    and chown get several less frequently used options, od is significantly
-    bigger but matches GNU coreutils, etc. Intended to eventually make
-    busybox a viable alternative for "standard" utilities for slightly
-    adventurous desktop users.
-    <p>Changes since previous release:
-    <ul>
-    <li>find: taking many more of standard options
-    <li>ps: POSIX-compliant -o implemented
-    <li>cp: added -s, -l
-    <li>grep: added -r, fixed -h
-    <li>watch: make it exec child like standard one does (was totally
-        incompatible)
-    <li>tar: fix limitations which were preventing bbox tar usage
-        on big directories: long names and linknames, pax headers
-        (Linux kernel tarballs have that). Fixed a number of obscure bugs.
-        Raised max file limit (now 64Gb). Security fixes (/../ attacks).
-    <li>httpd: added -i (inetd), -f (foreground), support for
-        directory indexer CGI (example is included), bugfixes.
-    <li>telnetd: fixed/improved IPv6 support, inetd+standalone support,
-        other fixes. Useful IPv6 stuff factored out into libbb.
-    <li>runit/*: new applets adapted from http://smarden.sunsite.dk/runit/
-        (these are my personal favorite small-and-beautiful toys)
-    <li>minor bugfixes to: login, dd, mount, umount, chmod, chown, ln, udhcp,
-        fdisk, ifconfig, sort, tee, mkswap, wget, insmod.
-    </ul>
-    <p>Note that GnuPG key used to sign this release is different.

-
-    <p>This release has dozens of fixes backported from the ongoing development
-    branch.  There are a couple of bugfixes to sed, two fixes to documentation
-    generation (BusyBox.html shouldn't have USE() macros in it anymore), fix
-    umount to report the right errno on failure and to umount block devices by
-    name with newer kernels, fix mount to handle symlinks properly, make mdev
-    delete device nodes when called for hotplug remove, fix a segfault
-    in traceroute, a minor portability fix to md5sum option parsing, a build
-    fix for httpd with old gccs, an options parsing tweak to hdparm, make test
-    fail gracefully when getgroups() returns -1, fix a race condition in
-    modprobe when two instances run at once (hotplug does this), make "tar xf
-    foo.tar dir/dir" extract all subdirectories, make our getty initialize the
-    terminal more like mingetty, an selinux build fix, an endianness fix in
-    ping6, fix for zcip defending addresses, clean up some global variables in
-    gzip to save memory, fix sulogin -tNNN, a help text tweak, several warning
-    fixes and build fixes, fixup dnsd a bit, and a partridge in a pear tree.</p>
-
-    <p>As <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/202106/">Linux Weekly News noted</a>,

-  <li><b>29 September 2006 -- New license email address.</b>
-    <p>The email address gpl@busybox.net is now the recommended way to contact
-    the Software Freedom Law Center to report BusyBox license violations.</p>
-
-  <li><b>31 July 2006 -- BusyBox 1.2.1 (stable)</b>
-    <p>Since nobody seems to have objected too loudly over the weekend, I
-    might as well point you all at
-    <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.2.1.tar.bz2">Busybox
-    1.2.1</a>, a bugfix-only release with no new features.</p>
-
-    <p>It has three shell fixes (two to lash: going "var=value" without
-    saying "export" should now work, plus a missing null pointer check, and
-    one to ash when redirecting output to a file that fills up.)  Fix three
-    embarassing thinkos in the new dmesg command.  Two build tweaks
-    (dependencies for the compressed usage messages and running make in the
-    libbb subdirectory).  One fix to tar so it can extract git-generated
-    tarballs (rather than barfing on the pax extensions).  And a partridge
-    in a pear...  Ahem.</p>
-
-    <p>But wait, there's more!  A passwd changing fix so an empty
-    gecos field doesn't trigger a false objection that the new passwd contains
-    the gecos field.  Make all our setuid() and setgid() calls check the return
-    value in case somebody's using per-process resource limits that prevent
-    a user from having too many processes (and thus prevent a process from
-    switching away from root, in which case the process will now _die_ rather
-    than continue with root privileges).  A fix to adduser to make sure that
-    /etc/group gets updated.  And a fix to modprobe to look for modules.conf
-    in the right place on 2.6 kernels.</p>
-
-  <li><b>30 June 2006 -- BusyBox 1.2.0</b>
-    <p>The -devel branch has been stabilized and the result is
-    <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.2.0.tar.bz2">Busybox
-    1.2.0</a>.  Lots of stuff changed, I need to work up a decent changelog
-    over the weekend.</p>
-
-    <p>I'm still experimenting with how long is best for the development
-    cycle, and since we've got some largeish projects queued up I'm going to
-    try a longer one.  Expect 1.3.0 in December.  (Expect 1.2.1 any time
-    we fix enough bugs. :)</p>
-
-    <p>Update: Here are <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.2.0.fixes.patch">the first few bug fixes</a> that will go into 1.2.1.</p>
-
-  <li><b>17 May 2006 -- BusyBox 1.1.3 (stable)</b>
-    <p><a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.1.3.tar.bz2">BusyBox
-    1.1.3</a> is another bugfix release.  It makes passwd use salt, fixes a
-    memory freeing bug in ls, fixes "build all sources at once" mode, makes
-    mount -a not abort on the first failure, fixes msh so ctrl-c doesn't kill
-    background processes, makes patch work with patch hunks that don't have a
-    timestamp, make less's text search a lot more robust (the old one could
-    segfault), and fixes readlink -f when built against uClibc.</p>
-
-    <p>Expect 1.2.0 sometime next month, which won't be a bugfix release.</p>
-
-  <li><b>10 April 2006 -- BusyBox 1.1.2 (stable)</b>
-    <p>You can now download <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.1.2.tar.bz2">BusyBox 1.1.2</a>, a bug fix release consisting of 11 patches
-    backported from the development branch: Some build fixes, several fixes
-    for mount and nfsmount, a fix for insmod on big endian systems, a fix for
-    find -xdev, and a fix for comm.  Check the file "changelog" in the tarball
-    for more info.</p>
-
-    <p>The next new development release (1.2.0) is slated for June.  A 1.1.3
-    will be released before then if more bug fixes crop up.  (The new plan is
-    to have a 1.x.0 new development release every 3 months, with 1.x.y stable
-    bugfix only releases based on that as appropriate.)</p>

-  <li><b>27 March 2006 -- Software Freedom Law Center representing BusyBox and uClibc</b>
-    <p>One issue Erik Andersen wanted to resolve when handing off BusyBox
-    maintainership to Rob Landley was license enforcement.  BusyBox and

-    by Erik's father's law firm, and the
-    <a href="http://www.busybox.net/shame.html">Hall of Shame</a>), haven't
-    scaled to match the popularity of the projects.  So we put our heads

-    <p>Update: Rather than put out an endless stream of 1.1.1.x releases,
-    the various small fixes have been collected together into a
-    <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.1.1.fixes.patch">patch</a>,

-    the first prerelease of 1.1.0.  This prerelease includes a lot of
-    <a href="http://www.busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html">new
-    functionality</a>: new applets, new features, and extensive rewrites of
-    several existing applets.  This prerelease should be noticeably more

-  <li><b>13 January 2005 -- Bug and Patch Tracking</b><p>
-
-    Bug reports sometimes get lost when posted to the mailing list.  The
-    developers of BusyBox are busy people, and have only so much they can keep
-    in their brains at a time. In my case, I'm lucky if I can remember my own
-    name, much less a bug report posted last week... To prevent your bug report
-    from getting lost, if you find a bug in BusyBox, please use the
-    <a href="https://bugs.busybox.net/">shiny new Bug and Patch Tracking System</a>
-    to post all the gory details.
-
-    <p>
-
-    The same applies to patches... Regardless of whether your patch
-    is a bug fix or adds spiffy new features, please post your patch
-    to the Bug and Patch Tracking System to make certain it is
-    properly considered.

-  <li><b>13 October 2004 -- BusyBox 1.00 released</b><p>
-
-    When you take a careful look at nearly every embedded Linux device or
-    software distribution shipping today, you will find a copy of BusyBox.
-    With countless routers, set top boxes, wireless access points, PDAs, and
-    who knows what else, the future for Linux and BusyBox on embedded devices
-    is looking very bright.
-
-    <p>
-
-    It is therefore with great satisfaction that I declare each and every
-    device already shipping with BusyBox is now officially out of date.
-    The highly anticipated release of BusyBox 1.00 has arrived!
-
-    <p>
-
-    Over three years in development, BusyBox 1.00 represents a tremendous
-    improvement over the old 0.60.x stable series.  Now featuring a Linux
-    KernelConf based configuration system (as used by the Linux kernel),
-    Linux 2.6 kernel support, many many new applets, and the development
-    work and testing of thousands of people from around the world.
-
-    <p>
-
-    If you are already using BusyBox, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade to
-    BusyBox 1.00.  If you are considering developing an embedded Linux device
-    or software distribution, you may wish to investigate if using BusyBox is
-    right for your application.  If you need help getting started using
-    BusyBox, if you wish to donate to help cover expenses, or if you find a bug
-    and need help reporting it, you are invited to visit the <a

-
-    I <b>really</b> want to get BusyBox 1.0.0 released soon and I see no real
-    reason why the 1.0.0 release shouldn't happen with things pretty much as
-    is.  BusyBox is in good shape at the moment, and it works nicely for
-    everything that I'm doing with it.  And from the reports I've been getting,
-    it works nicely for what most everyone else is doing with it as well.
-    There will eventually be a 1.0.1 anyway, so we might as well get on with
-    it.  No, BusyBox is not perfect.  No piece of software ever is.  And while
-    there is still plenty that can be done to improve things, most of that work
-    is waiting till we can get a solid 1.0.0 release out the door....

-    modutils issues.  For the new 2.6.x kernels, we already have
-    patches adding insmod and rmmod support and those need to be
-    integrated.  For 2.4.x kernels, for which busybox only supports
-    a limited number of architectures, we may want to invest a bit
-    more work before we cut 1.0.0.  Or we may just leave 2.4.x

-
-    Highlights of -pre2 include updating the 'ash' shell to sync up

-    it is with great pleasure that I announce the imminent release

-
-    I am very pleased to announce that the BusyBox 0.60.5 (stable)
-    is now available for download.  This is a bugfix release for
-    the stable series to address all the problems that have turned
-    up since the last release.  Unfortunately, the previous release
-    had a few nasty bugs (i.e. init could deadlock, gunzip -c tried
-    to delete source files, cp -a wouldn't copy symlinks, and init
-    was not always providing controlling ttys when it should have).
-    I know I said that the previous release would be the end of the
-    0.60.x series.  Well, it turns out I'm a liar.  But this time I
-    mean it (just like last time ;-).  This will be the last
-    release for the 0.60.x series --  all further development work
-    will be done for the development busybox tree.  Expect the development
-    version to have its first real release very very soon now...

-<b>3 January 2002 -- Welcome to busybox.net!</b>
-
-<p>Thanks to the generosity of a number of busybox
-users, we have been able to purchase busybox.net
-(which is where you are probably reading this).
-Right now, busybox.net and uclibc.org are both
-living on my home system (at the end of my DSL
-line). I apologize for the abrupt move off of
-busybox.lineo.com. Unfortunately, I no longer have
-the access needed to keep that system updated (for
-example, you might notice the daily snapshots there
-stopped some time ago).</p>
-
-<p>Busybox.net is currently hosted on my home
-server, at the end of a DSL line. Unfortunately,
-the load on them is quite heavy. To address this,
-I'm trying to make arrangements to get busybox.net
-co-located directly at an ISP. To assist in the
-co-location effort, <a href=
-"http://www.codepoet.org/~markw">Mark Whitley</a>
-(author of busybox sed, cut, and grep) has donated
-his <a href=
-"http://www.netwinder.org/">NetWinder</a> computer
-for hosting busybox.net and uclibc.org. Once this
-system is co-located, the current speed problems
-should be completely eliminated. Hopefully, too,
-some of you will volunteer to set up some mirror
-sites, to help to distribute the load a bit.</p>

- Since some people expressed concern over BusyBox
-donations, let me assure you that no one is getting
-rich here. All BusyBox and uClibc donations will be
-spent paying for bandwidth and needed hardware
-upgrades. For example, Mark's NetWinder currently
-has just 64Meg of memory. As demonstrated when
-google spidered the site the other day, 64 Megs in
-not enough, so I'm going to be ordering 256Megs of
-ram and a larger hard drive for the box today. So
-far, donations received have been sufficient to
-cover almost all expenses. In the future, we may
-have co-location fees to worry about, but for now
-we are ok. A <b>HUGE thank-you</b> goes out to
-everyone that has contributed!<br>

-<b>20 November 2001 -- BusyBox 0.60.2 released</b>
-
-<p>We am very pleased to announce that the BusyBox
-0.60.2 (stable) is now released to the world. This
-one is primarily a bugfix release for the stable
-series, and it should take care of most everyone's
-needs till we can get the nice new stuff we have
-been working on in CVS ready to release (with the
-wonderful new buildsystem). The biggest change in
-this release (beyond bugfixes) is the fact that msh
-(the minix shell) has been re-worked by Vladimir N.
-Oleynik (vodz) and so it no longer crashes when
-told to do complex things with backticks.</p>
-
-<p>This release has been tested on x86, ARM, and
-powerpc using glibc 2.2.4, libc5, and uClibc, so it
-should work with just about any Linux system you
-throw it at. See the <a href=
-"downloads/Changelog">changelog</a> for <small>most
-of</small> the details. The last release was
-<em>very</em> solid for people, and this one should
-be even better.</p>

-I've contacted the current owner of busybox.net and he is willing
-to sell the domain name -- for $250.  He also owns busybox.org but
-will not part with it...  I will then need to pay the registry fee
-for a couple of years and start paying for bandwidth, so this will
-initially cost about $300.  I would like to host busybox.net on my
-home machine (codepoet.org) so I have full control over the system,
-but to do that would require that I increase the level of bandwidth
-I am paying for.  Did you know that so far this month, there
-have been over 1.4 Gigabytes of busybox ftp downloads?  I don't
-even <em>know</em> how much CVS bandwidth it requires.  For the
-time being, Lineo has continued to graciously provide this
-bandwidth, despite the fact that I no longer work for them.  If I
-start running this all on my home machine, paying for the needed bandwidth
-will start costing some money.
-<p>
-
-I was going to pay it all myself, but my wife didn't like that
-idea at all (big surprise).   It turns out &lt;insert argument
-where she wins and I don't&gt; she has better ideas
-about what we should spend our money on that don't involve
-busybox.  She suggested I should ask for contributions on the
-mailing list and web page.  So...
-<p>
-
-I am hoping that if everyone could contribute a bit, we could pick
-up the busybox.net domain name and cover the bandwidth costs.  I
-know that busybox is being used by a lot of companies as well as
-individuals -- hopefully people and companies that are willing to
-contribute back a bit.  So if everyone could please help out, that
-would be wonderful!

-<li> <b>23 August 2001 -- BusyBox 0.60.1 released</b>
-<br>
-
-     This is a relatively minor bug fixing release that fixes
-     up the bugs that have shown up in the stable release in
-     the last few weeks.  Fortunately, nothing <em>too</em>
-     serious has shown up.  This release only fixes bugs -- no
-     new features, no new applets.  So without further ado,
-     here it is.  Come and get it.
-     <p>
-     The
-     <a href="downloads/Changelog">changelog</a> has all
-     the details.  As usual BusyBox 0.60.1 can be downloaded from

-<li> <b>2 August 2001 -- BusyBox 0.60.0 released</b>
-<br>
-     I am very pleased to announce the immediate availability of
-     BusyBox 0.60.0.  I have personally tested this release with libc5, glibc,
-     and <a href="http://uclibc.org/">uClibc</a> on
-     x86, ARM, and powerpc using linux 2.2 and 2.4, and I know a number
-     of people using it on everything from ia64 to m68k with great success.
-     Everything seems to be working very nicely now, so getting a nice
-     stable bug-free(tm) release out seems to be in order.   This releases fixes
-     a memory leak in syslogd, a number of bugs in the ash and msh shells, and
-     cleans up a number of things.
-
-     <p>
-
-     Those wanting an easy way to test the 0.60.0 release with uClibc can
-     use <a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User-Mode Linux</a>
-     to give it a try by downloading and compiling
-     <a href="ftp://busybox.net/buildroot.tar.gz">buildroot.tar.gz</a>.
-     You don't have to be root or reboot your machine to run test this way.
-     Preconfigured User-Mode Linux kernel source is also on busybox.net.
-     <p>
-     Another cool thing is the nifty <a href="downloads/tutorial/index.html">
-     BusyBox Tutorial</a> contributed by K Computing.  This requires
-     a ShockWave plugin (or standalone viewer), so you may want to grab the
-     the GPLed shockwave viewer from <a href="http://www.swift-tools.com/Flash/flash-0.4.10.tgz">here</a>
-     to view the tutorial.
-     <p>
-
-     Finally, In case you didn't notice anything odd about the
-     version number of this release, let me point out that this release
-     is <em>not</em> 0.53, because I bumped the version number up a
-     bit.  This reflects the fact that this release is intended to form
-     a new stable BusyBox release series.  If you need to rely on a
-     stable version of BusyBox, you should plan on using the stable
-     0.60.x series.  If bugs show up then I will release 0.60.1, then
-     0.60.2, etc...  This is also intended to deal with the fact that
-     the BusyBox build system will be getting a major overhaul for the
-     next release and I don't want that to break products that people
-     are shipping.  To avoid that, the new build system will be
-     released as part of a new BusyBox development series that will
-     have some not-yet-decided-on odd version number.  Once things
-     stabilize and the new build system is working for everyone, then
-     I will release that as a new stable release series.

-     release is the result of <em>many</em> hours of work and has tons

-     <p>
-     The

-
-<li> <b>10 April 2001 -- BusyBox 0.51 released</b>
-<br>
-
-     BusyBox 0.51 (the "rock-solid release") is now out there.  This
-     release adds only 2 new applets: env and vi.  The vi applet,
-     contributed by Sterling Huxley, is very functional, and is only
-     22k.  This release fixes 3 critical bugs in the 0.50 release.
-     There were 2 potential segfaults in lash (the busybox shell) in
-     the 0.50 release which are now fixed.  Another critical bug in
-     0.50 which is now fixed: syslogd from 0.50 could potentially
-     deadlock the init process and thereby break your entire system.
-     <p>
-
-     There are a number of improvements in this release as well.  For
-     one thing, the wget applet is greatly improved.  Dmitry Zakharov
-     added FTP support, and Laurence Anderson make wget fully RFC
-     compliant for HTTP 1.1.  The mechanism for including utility
-     functions in previous releases was clumsy and error prone.  Now
-     all utility functions are part of a new libbb library, which makes
-     maintaining utility functions much simpler.  And BusyBox now
-     compiles on itanium systems (thanks to the Debian itanium porters
-     for letting me use their system!).

-<br>
-
-     This release adds several new applets including ifconfig, route, pivot_root, stty,
-     and tftp, and also fixes tons of bugs.  Tab completion in the
-     shell is now working very well, and the shell's environment variable
-     expansion was fixed.   Tons of other things were fixed or made
-     smaller.  For a fairly complete overview, see the

-     <p>
-     lash (the busybox shell) is still with us, fixed up a bit so it
-     now behaves itself quite nicely.  It really is quite usable as
-     long as you don't expect it to provide Bourne shell grammer.
-     Standard things like pipes, redirects, command line editing, and
-     environment variable expansion work great.  But we have found that
-     this shell, while very usable, does not provide an extensible
-     framework for adding in full Bourne shell behavior.  So the first order of
-     business as we begin working on the next BusyBox release will be to merge in the new shell

-     <em>Special Note</em><br>
-
-     BusyBox 0.49 was supposed to have replaced lash, the BusyBox
-     shell, with a new shell that understands full Bourne shell/Posix shell grammer.
-     Well, that simply didn't happen in time for this release.  A new
-     shell that will eventually replace lash is already under
-     construction.  This new shell is being developed by Larry
-     Doolittle, and could use all of our help.  Please see the work in
-     progress on <a href="http://doolittle.faludi.com/~larry/parser.html">Larry's website</a>

-     update of course: tar no longer breaks hardlinks, tar -xzf is
-     optionally supported, and the LRP folks will be pleased to know
-     that 'tar -X' and 'tar --exclude' are both now in.  Applets are
-     now looked up using a binary search making lash (the busybox
-     shell) much faster.  For the new debian-installer (for Debian
-     woody) a .udeb can now be generated.

-<p> <li> <b>26 September 2000 -- BusyBox 0.47 released</b>
-<br>
-
-     This release fixes lots of bugs (including an ugly bug in 0.46
-     syslogd that could fork-bomb your system).  Added several new
-     apps: rdate, wget, getopt, dos2unix, unix2dos, reset, unrpm,
-     renice, xargs, and expr.  syslogd now supports network logging.
-     There are the usual tar updates.  Most apps now use getopt for

-
-<p> <li> <b>11 July 2000 -- BusyBox 0.46 released</b>
-<br>
-
-     This release fixes several bugs (including a ugly bug in tar,
-     and fixes for NFSv3 mount support).  Added a dumpkmap to allow
-     people to dump a binary keymaps for use with 'loadkmap', and a
-     completely reworked 'grep' and 'sed' which should behave better.
-     BusyBox shell can now also be used as a login shell.

-<p> <li> <b>21 June 2000 -- BusyBox 0.45 released</b>
-<br>
-
-     This release has been slow in coming, but is very solid at this
-     point.  BusyBox now supports libc5 as well as GNU libc.  This
-     release provides the following new apps: cut, tr, insmod, ar,
-     mktemp, setkeycodes, md5sum, uuencode, uudecode, which, and
-     telnet.  There are bug fixes for just about every app as well (see
-     the <a href="downloads/Changelog">changelog</a> for
-     details).
-     <p>
-     Also, some exciting infrastructure news!  Busybox now has its own
-     <a href="lists/busybox/">mailing list</a>,
-     publically browsable
-     <a href="http://sources.busybox.net/index.py/trunk/busybox/">CVS tree</a>,

-     for those that are actively contributing there is even
-     <a href="cvs_write.html">CVS write access</a>.
-     I think this will be a huge help to the ongoing development of BusyBox.
-     <p>
-     Also, for the curious, there is no 0.44 release.  Somehow 0.44 got announced
-     a few weeks ago prior to its actually being released.  To avoid any confusion
-     we are just skipping 0.44.

-it should be logging stuff from both "A" and "B".  As released in 0.43 only stuff
-from "A" would have been logged.  This means that if init tries to log something
-while say ppp has the syslog open, init would block (which is bad, bad, bad).
-<p>
-Karl M. Hegbloom has created a fix for the problem.
-Thanks Karl!

-
-<p> <li> <b>18 April 2000 -- BusyBox 0.43 released (finally!)</b>
-<br>
-I have finally gotten everything into a state where I feel pretty
-good about things.  This is definitely the most stable, solid release
-so far.  A lot of bugs have been fixed, and the following new apps
-have been added: sh, basename, dirname, killall, uptime,
-freeramdisk, tr, echo, test, and usleep.  Tar has been completely
-rewritten from scratch.  Bss size has also been greatly reduced.
-More details are available in the
-<a href="downloads/Changelog">changelog</a>.
-Oh, and as a special bonus, I wrote some fairly comprehensive
-<em>documentation</em>, complete with examples and full usage information.
-
-<p>
-Many thanks go out to the fine people that have helped by submitting patches
-and bug reports; particularly instrumental in helping for this release were
-Karl Hegbloom, Pavel Roskin, Friedrich Vedder, Emanuele Caratti,
-Bob Tinsley, Nicolas Pitre, Avery Pennarun, Arne Bernin, John Beppu, and Jim Gleason.
-There were others so if I somehow forgot to mention you, I'm very sorry.
-<p>
-
-You can grab BusyBox 0.43 tarballs <a href="downloads">here</a>.
-
-<p> <li> <b>9 April 2000 -- BusyBox 0.43 pre release</b>
-<br>
-Unfortunately, I have not yet finished all the things I want to
-do for BusyBox 0.43, so I am posting this pre-release for people
-to poke at.  This contains my complete rewrite of tar, which now weighs in at
-5k (7k with all options turned on) and works for reading and writing
-tarballs (which it does correctly for everything I have been able to throw
-at it).  Tar also (optionally) supports the "--exclude" option (mainly because
-the Linux Router Project folks asked for it).  This also has a pre-release
-of the micro shell I have been writing.  This pre-release should be stable
-enough for production use -- it just isn't a release since I have some structural
-changes I still want to make.
-<p>
-The pre-release can be found <a href="downloads">here</a>.
-Please let me know ASAP if you find <em>any</em> bugs.
-
-<p> <li> <b>28 March 2000 -- Andersen Baby Boy release</b>
-<br>
-I am pleased to announce that on Tuesday March 28th at 5:48pm, weighing in at 7
-lbs. 12 oz, Micah Erik Andersen was born at LDS Hospital here in Salt Lake City.
-He was born in the emergency room less then 5 minutes after we arrived -- and
-it was such a relief that we even made it to the hospital at all.  Despite the
-fact that I was driving at an amazingly unlawful speed and honking at everybody
-and thinking decidedly unkind thoughts about the people in our way, my wife
-(inconsiderate of my feelings and complete lack of medical training) was lying
-down in the back seat saying things like "I think I need to start pushing now"
-(which she then proceeded to do despite my best encouraging statements to the
-contrary).
-<p>
-Anyway, I'm glad to note that despite the much-faster-than-we-were-expecting
-labor, both Shaunalei and our new baby boy are doing wonderfully.
-<p>
-So now that I am done with my excuse for the slow release cycle...
-Progress on the next release of BusyBox has been slow but steady.  I expect
-to have a release sometime during the first week of April.  This release will
-include a number of important changes, including the addition of a shell, a
-re-write of tar (to accommodate the Linux Router Project), and syslogd can now
-accept multiple concurrent connections, fixing lots of unexpected blocking
-problems.
-
-
-<p> <li> <b>11 February 2000 -- BusyBox 0.42 released</b>
-<br>
-
-     This is the most solid BusyBox release so far.  Many, many
-	bugs have been fixed.   See the
-	<a href="downloads/Changelog">changelog</a> for details.
-
-	Of particular interest, init will now cleanly unmount
-	filesystems on reboot, cp and mv have been rewritten and
-	behave much better, and mount and umount no longer leak
-	loop devices.  Many thanks go out to Randolph Chung,
-	Karl M. Hegbloom, Taketoshi Sano, and Pavel Roskin for
-	their hard work on this release of BusyBox.  Please pound
-	on it and let me know if you find any bugs.
-
-<p> <li> <b>19 January 2000 -- BusyBox 0.41 released</b>
-<br>
-
-     This release includes bugfixes to cp, mv, logger, true, false,
-	mkdir, syslogd, and init.  New apps include wc, hostid,
-	logname, tty, whoami, and yes.  New features include loop device
-	support in mount and umount, and better TERM handling by init.
-	The changelog can be found <a href="downloads/Changelog">here</a>.
-
-<p> <li> <b>7 January 2000 -- BusyBox 0.40 released</b>
-<br>
-
-     This release includes bugfixes to init (now includes inittab support),
-     syslogd, head, logger, du, grep, cp, mv, sed, dmesg, ls, kill, gunzip, and mknod.
-     New apps include sort, uniq, lsmod, rmmod, fbset, and loadacm.
-     In particular, this release fixes an important bug in tar which
-     in some cases produced serious security problems.
-     As always, the changelog can be found <a href="downloads/Changelog">here</a>.

-<h3>Hall of Shame!!!</h3>
-
-<p>This page is no longer updated, these days we forward this sort of
-thing to the <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org">Software Freedom Law
-Center</a> instead.</p>
-
-<p>The following products and/or projects appear to use BusyBox, but do not
-appear to release source code as required by the <a
-href="/license.html">BusyBox license</a>.  This is a violation of the law!
-The distributors of these products are invited to contact <a href=
-"mailto:andersen@codepoet.org">Erik Andersen</a> if they have any confusion
-as to what is needed to bring their products into compliance, or if they have
-already brought their product into compliance and wish to be removed from the
-Hall of Shame.
-
-<p>
-
-Here are the details of <a href="/license.html">exactly how to comply
-with the BusyBox license</a>, so there should be no question as to
-exactly what is expected.
-Complying with the Busybox license is easy and completely free, so the
-companies listed below should be ashamed of themselves.  Furthermore, each
-product listed here is subject to being legally ordered to cease and desist
-distribution for violation of copyright law, and the distributor of each
-product is subject to being sued for statutory copyright infringement damages
-of up to $150,000 per work plus legal fees.  Nobody wants to be sued, and <a
-href="mailto:andersen@codepoet.org">Erik</a> certainly would prefer to spend
-his time doing better things than sue people.  But he will sue if forced to
-do so to maintain compliance.
-
-<p>
-
-Do everyone a favor and don't break the law -- if you use busybox, comply with
-the busybox license by releasing the source code with your product.

-<h3>Accessing Source</h3>
-
-
-
-<h3>Patches</h3>
-
-<p>You can <a href="downloads/">download</a> fixes for particular releases
-of busybox, e.g. downloads/fixes-<em>major</em>-<em>minor</em>-<em>patch</em>/
-
-<h3>Anonymous Subversion Access</h3>
-
-We allow anonymous (read-only) Subversion (svn) access to everyone.  To
-grab a copy of the latest version of BusyBox using anonymous svn access:
-
-<pre>
-svn co svn://busybox.net/trunk/busybox</pre>
-
-<p>
-The <em>stable branches</em> can be obtained with
-<pre>
-svn co svn://busybox.net/branches/busybox_1_NN_stable
-</pre>
-
-<p>
-
-If you are not already familiar with using Subversion, I recommend you visit <a
-href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">the Subversion website</a>.  You might
-also want to read online or buy a copy of <a
-href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">the Subversion Book</a>.  If you are
-already comfortable with using CVS, you may want to skip ahead to the <a
-href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/apa.html">Subversion for CVS Users</a>
-part of the Subversion Book.
-
-<p>
-
-Once you've checked out a copy of the source tree, you can update your source
-tree at any time so it is in sync with the latest and greatest by entering your
-BusyBox directory and running the command:
-
-<pre>
-svn update</pre>
-
-Because you've only been granted anonymous access to the tree, you won't be
-able to commit any changes. Changes can be submitted for inclusion by posting
-them to the BusyBox mailing list.  For those that are actively contributing
-<a href="developer.html">Subversion commit access</a> can be made available.

-<h3>External Tiny Utilities</h3>
-
-This is a list of tiny utilities whose functionality is not provided by
-busybox.  If you have additional suggestions, please send an e-mail to our
-dev mailing list.
-
-<br><br>
-
-<table>
-<tr>
- <th>Feature</th>
- <th>Utilities</th>
-</tr>
-
-<tr>
- <td>SSH</td>
- <td><a href="http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/">Dropbear</a> has both an ssh server and an ssh client that together come in around 100k.  It has no external
-dependencies (I.E. it does not depend on OpenSSL, using a built-in copy of
-LibTomCrypt instead).  It's actively maintained, with a quiet but responsive
-mailing list.</td>
-</tr>
-
-<tr>
- <td>SMTP</td>
- <td><a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/ssmtp/">ssmtp</a> is an extremely simple Mail Transfer Agent.</td>
-</tr>
-
-<tr>
-  <td>ntp</td>
-  <td><a href="http://doolittle.icarus.com/ntpclient/">ntpclient</a> is a
-tiny ntp client.  BusyBox has rdate to set the date from a remote server, but
-if you want a daemon to repeatedly adjust the clock over time, try that.</td>
-</table>
-
-<p>In a gui environment, you'll probably want a web browser.
-<a href="http://www.konqueror.org/embedded/">Konqueror Embedded</a> requires QT
-(or QT Embedded), but not KDE.  The <a href="http://www.dillo.org/">Dillo</a>
-requires GTK+, but not Gnome.  Or you can try the <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">graphical
-version of links</a>.</p>
-
-<h3>SCRIPTING LANGUAGES</h3>
-<p>Although busybox has built-in support for shell scripts, plenty of other
-small scripting languages are available on the net.  A few examples:</p>
-<table>
-<tr>
-<th>language</th>
-<th>description</th>
-</tr>
-<tr>
-<td> <a href="http://www.foo.be/docs/tpj/issues/vol5_3/tpj0503-0003.html">microperl</a> </td>
-<td> A small standalone perl interpreter that can be built from the perl source
-s via "make -f Makefile.micro".  If you really feel the need for perl on an embe
-dded system, this is where to start.
-</tr>
-<tr>
-
-<td><a href="http://www.lua.org/pil/">Lua</a></td>
-<td>If you just want a small embedded scripting language to write <em>new</em>
-code in, this Brazilian import is lightweight, fairly popular, and has
-a complete book about it online.</td>
-</tr>
-
-<tr>
-<td><a href="http://www.star.le.ac.uk/%7Etjg/rc/">rc</a></td>
-<td>The PLAN9 shell.  Not compatible with conventional bourne shell syntax,
-but fairly lightweight and small.</td>
-</tr>
-
-</tr>
-<tr>
-<td><a href="http://www.forth.org/">forth</a></td>
-<td>A well known language for fast and small programs, decades old but still
-in use for everything from OpenBIOS to computer controlled engine timing.</td>
-</tr>
-</table>
-
-<p>For more information, you probably want to look at
-<a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">buildroot</a> and
-<a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/TinyGentoo">TinyGentoo</a>, which
-build and use tiny utilities for all sorts of things.</p>
