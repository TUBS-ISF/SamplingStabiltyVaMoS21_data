+although any new or updated metainformation SHOULD be applied
+to the document currently in the user agent's active view.

+The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body, and thus
+is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields."

+However, in real world it was observed that some web servers
+(e.g. Boa/0.94.14rc21) simply use code 204 when file size is zero.
