 Attempts to cut and paste the information into a local busybox header file
 proved incredibly painful, because portions of the loop_info structure vary by
 architecture, namely the type __kernel_dev_t has different sizes on alpha,
-arm, x86, and so on.  Meaning we either #include <linux/posix_types.h> or
+arm, x86, and so on.  Meaning we either #include &lt;linux/posix_types.h&gt; or
 we hardwire #ifdefs to check what platform we're building on and define this
 type appropriately for every single hardware architecture supported by
 Linux, which is simply unworkable.</p>
